# Web Dev Roadmap

## 1. Start with learning the basics of HTML & CSS

    Follow 1-3 tutorials and make some sites.

#### Some Resources are :-

    2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxWf493en4

    4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQimoqo0-7g


## Note:- 
    Don't just copy what they do try understanding the things and exploring.

    Think why we need this html element or this styling element.

    And lastly try making some of your own sites as trials.
    
    If you are out of ideas then try cloning some the UI (User Interface) of sites like Youtube, Instagram etc etc


# 2. Start with Javascript
    Directly jump to Javascript when u have the minimum understanding of html & css, as while building projects we will learn the html and all

### Some Resources are :-

    This video will be enough to get started

# 3. Open a Github Account and learn about Github & Git
    Github is a platform where we can store our code as well as share them without any hastle, as well as track the changes made

# 4. Learn what API are.
    Try making some projects retaled with API
    Like :- 
        Weather App,
        News App etc

# Learn a database (Firebase for now)
    Firebase is a database provided by google which makes easier to store data in cloud.
    Firebase is very beginner friendly, so there won't be any problems at all.

    Make a CRUD App (Todo Application) { CRUD = Create Read Update Delete }
    By making this application you will understand how we can use firebase to do the CRUD stuff.

# Go Learn a UI Framework 
    Learning a UI framework makes it easier to make good sites as we can organise our codes much better and even reuse them

    Try learning React (as its most popular,  you can also go with others like angular/vue etc etc).

# Start learning the main things of the framework
    Try learning the main stuff like Props, States, Component Lifecycles, Hooks etc..

    Make a CRUD App (ToDo app), try making it with firebase integration also as this will make u more confident to go more.

## More steps coming in future........
